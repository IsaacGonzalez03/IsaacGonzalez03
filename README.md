### Howdy!

# My name is Isaac Gonzalez and I am a Full-Stack Developer! 

# After college I worked in the medical field a few years and wanted to make some improvements to the software we were using.  I asked myself how hard can it be? Turns out it was hard enough for me to change career paths completely!

# Been loving everything about it!

# I am currently learning to manage the Vue.js front-end w/ a C# MySql Backend - Looking to master this!
