# Howdy!

### My name is Isaac Gonzalez and I am a Full-Stack Developer! 

### After college I worked in the medical field a few years and wanted to make some improvements to the software we were using.  I asked myself how hard can it be? Turns out it was hard enough for me to change career paths completely!

### Been loving everything about it!

### Currently learning Angular!
